# What is it?
This is a project I'm working on that should allow me to create, store, and load patterns/animations for my RGB Strip.

# Okay that's cool but why?
I didn't want to make patterns by manually typing out the rgb values and whatnot, so I'm doing a lot more work to make this instead.

# Right so say I wanted to use it for my own strip
Good luck. I plan to make it more universal/customizable, but for now it's tailored to me and is nowhere near finished.

# I hate you
:D
